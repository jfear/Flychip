This README contains general information about the scripts found in my Flychip repo.

All scripts were written by me during my Ph.D. to process genome-wide data. They may not necessarily be the most efficient solution to a given problem!

Please see the wiki for an overview of my DamID analysis pipeline.

If you have any questions about any of the information here, feel free to contact me at sarahhcarl@gmail.com.
